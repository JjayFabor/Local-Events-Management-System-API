# **Local Events Management System API**

## **Overview**

Welcome to the Local Events Management System API project! This project is designed to help me learn and improve your skills in Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF).

The API allows for managing local events, including user authentication, event creation, registration, and searching/filtering of events.

 <!-- For detailed documentation on the API, please visit: [**_Local Events Management System API Documentation_**](/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) -->

<!-- ## **Project Roadmap**

### Week 3: Project Development and Deployment -->

## **Key Features**

### Admin

- Create and manage admin accounts.

### User Authentication:

- User registration and login.
- Token-based authentication.

### Event Management:

- CRUD operations for events.
- Fields: Event name, description, date, location, etc.
